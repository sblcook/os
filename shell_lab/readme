This is a basic Unix-based shell for the CIS 3207 Assignment created by Sam Cook.

This shell has several main commands. The commands and their implementation is as follows:

	1. cd <directory> : Changes the current directory to <directory>. If <directory> argument is missing, it will report its current directory. If <directory> is not found, it will report that. This will also change the pwd environment

	2. clr : Clears the screen by entering new line a specified amount of times, can be changed in source code. No argument needed.

	3. ls : Lists the contents of current directory

	4. environ: lists the current environment variable

	5. echo <comment>: Displays <comment> on a new line

	6. help : displays this manual

	7. quit : quits the shell

The command line prompt is the pathname of the current directory. This is also what appears when the 'pwd' command is used on a Unix shell.

This shell can also use pipes and redirection. 
	To send the output of a command to a file, use the format: command > file. If "file" does not already exist, it will create it. If "file" does exist, it will write over it.

	If you would instead like to append to an existing file if it already exists, use the format command >> file. It will still create "file" if it does not already exist, though.

	To take input and commands from a file, use the format: command < input.
